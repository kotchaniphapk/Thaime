    "paragraph1": "We are a couple brought together by love, culture, and a shared passion for great food. I am Thai, my husband is Romanian, and together we turned our dream into reality by bringing authentic Thai street food to Romania.",
    "paragraph2": "I grew up in Bangkok, Thailand, in a family where food was at the heart of everything we did. For more than 30 years, my family has been selling Thai food, and from a young age I helped in our family business—learning traditional recipes, cooking techniques, and the true flavors of Thai cuisine. Those experiences shaped not only my skills, but also my deep respect for Thai food and culture.",
    "paragraph3": "Today, I proudly bring those same family recipes and authentic flavors to our food truck here in Romania. Every dish we serve is inspired by my childhood, my family's kitchen, and the vibrant street food of Bangkok—prepared with fresh ingredients, love, and attention to detail.",
    "paragraph4": "Our food truck is more than just a place to eat; it's a bridge between Thailand and Romania, sharing stories, traditions, and flavors from our family to yours.",
